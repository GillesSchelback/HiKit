## :bulb: Why was this package created?

*HiKit* is a package created to combine everything that is related to the *Hi View*. This *View* gives the end user a glimpse of the developer who created the app and create a more personalised experience in a way. 

## :art: More about the design

Lately I've been a big fan of the designs created by Apple, there is something special about the way they use vibrant colours together with a simple modern layout. This was also the foundation and inspiration for these designs. As you can see I used the new background of the newly announced iOS 17 together with the use of some material provided in SwiftUI. I also chose to make a light and dark appearance to make the *View* fit better in the overall appearance chosen by the end user.

## :crystal_ball: What about the future?

I'm satisfied with the overall design of the *View* so don't expect any major design overhaul in the near future, some minor changes are still possible. There is still some finetuning required to make the project something I'm really proud of. The below items are the ones that are currently in the pipeline. 

<ul>
  <li>📦 Convert Framework to Swift Package ✅</li>
  <li>✏️ Implement translations</li>
  <li>📳 Implement Accessibility</li>
</ul>
